# A Simple React Todo List

  This todo list was created entirely by me, using only the knowledge that I have (other than the fact I had to look up how to use filter() x) ) but the main components that make up this project are as follows:

- Material UI
- React Hooks
  
  It took me a day and like 15 minutes the next morning to make this. I was about to look up some tutorials on YouTube BUT I ended up thinking of something in the middle of the night and with a fresh head, I was able to solve it.
